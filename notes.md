Tagged Union:
    .{ ... } only works for structs, couldn't type infer a tagged union
    at least in testing, cannot easily unwrap value (as of current knowledge)

Structs:
    much easier comparison between token literals, however requires allocation
    for the illegal token literal



All BS, tagged unions are fine, expectEqualDeep is necessary
